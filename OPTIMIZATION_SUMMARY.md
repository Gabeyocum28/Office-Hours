## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### **Redis Configuration Optimizations**
```python
redis_client = redis.Redis(
    host='localhost', 
    port=6379, 
    db=0, 
    decode_responses=True, 
    socket_timeout=2,
    socket_connect_timeout=1,
    connection_pool_kwargs={
        'max_connections': 50,
        'retry_on_timeout': True
    }
)
```

### **OpenAI Client Optimization**
```python
openai_client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key=openai_api_key,
    timeout=httpx.Timeout(30.0, connect=5.0),
    max_retries=1,
    http_client=httpx.Client(
        limits=httpx.Limits(
            max_connections=100,
            max_keepalive_connections=20,
            keepalive_expiry=30.0

### **Audio Processing Pipeline**
```javascript
// Minimal delay audio processing
const AUDIO_CHUNK_PLAYBACK_DELAY_MS = 10;

// Preloading for seamless playback
function preloadNextAudioChunk() {
    // Preload next audio chunk while current is playing
    // Enables zero-gap audio streaming
}
```
